Feeling stuck not knowing what else to add in your personal statement? Feeling the pressure to make everything as perfect as possible? Or do you feel so lost that you haven't even begun to write a single sentence? Writing a personal statement can feel like an arduous and stressful task, especially when your university application is on the line, but here's a few pointers that can hopefully make it easier.

# The Big Picture
Sometimes we get so caught up with the nitty gritty details of writing that we can't see the forest for the trees. Its always good to take some time to zoom out and look at the big picture before starting on a project like writing your personal statement. Here are a few things to think about before diving into the writing process.

## Goals of The personal Statement
Your aim for your personal statement should be to answer the questions that your admission tutor want answered. The main question that most admission tutors want answered is definitely -- Why do you want to pursue this course?. How well and how elaborately you answer this question will most likely determine how good your personal statement is. The other things you would want to convey through your personal statement can vary from university to university, and it would be a great idea to check out what your university has to say about what they are looking for in a personal statement. For example, Cambridge has a guide <a href = "https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/find-out-more/teachers-and-parents/helping-students-preparehere">here</a> for their applicants.

## How Academic Should Your Personal Statement be?
Short answer: at least 70%. The UK university hold academic ability to a very high importance when choosing applicants in contrast to the "holistic" assessment style of US universities and it is imperative that you keep this in mind when writing your personal statement to prevent spending too many words on non-academic content.

# First Draft Creation: QnA PS content generation
After getting a rough idea on the way your personal statement should be structured, you should get a first draft started as soon as possible. Important thing to remember: The first draft **DOESN'T** need to be perfect. Having a first draft allows you to make changes and its easier to edit than to make something out of thin air.

# What to include in your personal statement?
When deciding what to put in your personal statement, think about what putting it in your personal statement would convey to the admissions tutor in relation to what they're looking for. The following are a few things that you might consider adding.

## Are internships necessary?
No. It definitely helps to have one since it shows that you have taken concrete action in deepening your understanding of your subject. It also shows that you have gotten exposure to the work associated with. However, there are many ways to take steps to expose yourself to your subject. For example, since I did not get a chance to do an internship, I emailed a few professors from local universities and inquired on academic topics in my field. Be creative and find your way to learn more about your subject.

## Online Course?
If you have the time for it I definitely recommend doing online courses related to your course. I have always been doing online courses and it gives you a chance to explore many different topics in your topic for your to expand upon in your personal statement and the relevant basic terminology and fundamental ideas to understand it. If your university has an interview stage, your interview might even contain material that you've covered in an online course you've taken. (That certainly was the case for me, but that's a story for another post)

## On Extracurriculars
If you're applying to universities that heavily value academics, it might be beneficial to include more extracurriculars that are related to your field of study. Whenever you mention an extracurricular activity make sure to explain what skill you've gained from it and how it makes you a good fit for studying in the universities you're applying to.

# Finishing Touches and Feedback

## Should I let others take a look at my personal statement?
Definitely yes. It always helps to have a second opinion on your personal statement to ensure that your personal statement is conveying what you intend to convey. However, too many cooksüë®‚Äçüç≥ spoil the broth, don't let different viewpoints confuse you and think before accepting someone's feedback on your personal statement.
