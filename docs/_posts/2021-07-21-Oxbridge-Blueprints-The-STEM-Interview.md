The Oxbridge interviews are one of the main criteria for selecting successful applicants. If you apply from select countries overseas, you will have one interview. If you fly to the UK in non-pandemic years, you will get 2 interviews. This post will guide you through some insights and ideas that might help your interview preparation process and provide interview techniques that will help flesh out your academic capabilities to your interviewer.

# The Academic Interview
The interview is an academically focused one. It matters less of who you are and how you present yourself and what matters most is how you think. The interview is meant to simulate a supervision in Cambridge or a tutorial in Oxford so they can ascertain whether or not you are suited for this way of learning.

# Structure of the Interview
The generic interview structure is as follows. It starts with a warm up question or two to help with your nerves. Then your interviewer might ask you a question in your personal statement, followed by a few technical questions comprising of problems that are related to your field.

## Warm Up Questions
They usually are simple questions that should be obvious to you as an applicant, such as "Why did you choose Engineering?" or "Why Choose Pembroke College". If you don't feel confident in giving answers to these questions in a surefire way, be sure to have some prepared answers to these questions so that you won't spend unnecessary time thinking and fretting about the answers. An important thing to remember when answering these questions is to show your passion and enthusiasm when answering them. If the passion and enthusiasm shown in your personal statement isn't shown during your interview it might cause your interviewer to doubt how genuine your personal statement is.

## The Personal Statement Related Question
You should know every single part of your personal statement inside out. Writing down something on your personal statement implies that this is something that you feel represents your understanding of your subject or explains your passion towards the subject. A good way to test your understanding of your personal statement is to ask friends and teachers to read through your personal statement and ask questions about parts that they are interested in. If you can answer those questions in a way that a lay man can understand the concept, you have sufficiently prepared for this question. Another way is going through each sentence that contains academic content and trying to ask questions that go deeper into the subject and attempt to understand it.

Here is an example for Engineering or Physics. If your personal statement explained the idea of moment of inertia and equations related to it when an object spins about an axis, questions you might ask is "What happens if there is rotation about multiple axes? What equations are used to mathematically model the motion of the object?".

Here is an example for a Mathematics applicant. If your personal statement contains a passage expressing your astonishment at the beauty of Green's Theorem or the Divergence theorem. It might be a good idea go through the proofs of those theories and some intuitive explanations and visualizations behind those theories.

## Technical Questions
In this part of the interview, you will be asked questions related to your field to study. Another constraint on the questions for Cambridge applicants is that they will be somewhat related to the modules you have listed in your COPA application(essentially what chapters you have covered so far in your A Levels syllabus). Oxford applicants will also receive questions related to their syllabus but they will make assumptions based on the less specific UCAS application that does not include the modules that you have covered thus far.

# Preparing for the Interview

## Internalize the A Level syllabus
Mastering the A Level syllabus is the bare minimum requirement to do well in the interview. Especially for STEM subjects where concepts are built upon each other, having strong fundamentals will really help your experience during the interview. A way to ensure you have completely grasped all the required concepts is to have a checklist based off the syllabus content and check off everything that you feel confident in explaining and applying in a problem solving question.

## Practice Interview Questions
Interview questions often are a bit different from questions your see in textbooks or normal past year papers. They require a bit more thinking outside the box and often requires you to use your existing knowledge as a stepping stone to deduce new information required to solve the problem. Here are a few sources that provide you with some questions that train those problem solving muscles required for the Oxbridge Interview.

### Physics and Engineering

1. [I Want to Study Engineering Website](https://i-want-to-study-engineering.org/)

This website contains around 200 interview level problems alongside with hints and video solutions to them. Although some explanations are not that clear but it is still a valuable practice resource to have.

2. [Isaac Physics](https://isaacphysics.org/)

Even though this website is notorious for being slightly annoying for troubles with submitting answers, it is nonetheless a good question bank for interview preparation needs. I recommend trying all problems at Level 5 and 6. Another good set of questions in this section is the [Extraordinary Problems Section](https://isaacphysics.org/extraordinary_problems).

3. [PAT Past Papers](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/study/undergraduates/how-apply/physics-aptitude-test-pat/pat-past-papers)

Not all questions in the PAT are suitable as interview practice, but for the recent years, the questions that have a higher point allocation have been found to be good practice for interviews.

4. [British Physics Olympiad](https://www.bpho.org.uk/past-papers/round-1)

5. [IPHO Problems and Solutions](https://physprob.com/)

6. [Professor Povey's Perplexing Problems](https://www.amazon.com/Professor-Poveys-Perplexing-Problems-Pre-university/dp/1780747756#:~:text=Professor%20Povey's%20Perplexing%20Problems%20is,problems%20in%20physics%20and%20maths.)

This book is a good book with interesting problems and good explanations behind them. However do selectively do problems that are related to your field. This can be done by doing questions only from relevant chapters.

### Mathematics and Computer Science
Side Note: I'm not that sure about computer science but I assume that their interviews are also highly mathematical.

1. [STEP Questions Database](https://stepdatabase.maths.org/database/index.html)

A compilation of all the STEP questions. This site allows you to search for STEP past questions according to topic.

2. [STEP Foundation Modules](https://maths.org/step/assignments)

This site contains modules of questions to train you to be able to solve interview questions and STEP questions. The modules introduce the concept using warm-up questions and slowly crank up the difficulty so you aren't overwhelmed.

3. [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

If you have some form of programming skills, this website is packed to the brim with mathematical computing challenges. I believe that these challenges will train you with the problem solving skills needed for the interview.

4. [Art of Problem Solving Resources](https://artofproblemsolving.com/resources)

This website has a ton of mathematical resources for your perusal and are the furthest thing away from your typical math problem.

## Mock Interviews
The best way to prepare for an exam is to do past papers and have mock exams. Similarly, the best way to prepare for an interview is to have mock interviews. I recommend doing at least 5 mock interviews before your actual interview. This can be done with your subject teachers, seniors who have gone through the interview themselves, or people from companies and societies that offer mock interviews. (I am offering free Engineering mock interviews until mid September 2021, for details read till the end of this post)

## Advanced Learning
For engineering especially, there isn't too large of a scope of things that the interviewer can ask due to the constriction of the A Levels Syllabus. Of course, they can extend ideas from the A Levels syllabus, but they can only go so far. Hence you can predict some advanced topics that might come out in the interview ahead of time and learn them. Obviously I advise against blindly learning the concepts without truly understanding it and regurgitating formulae during the interview itself. The point of the interview is to see how you think not what you know after all. But I wouldn't deny that being exposed to these advanced topics would definitely help you. The process of learning these topics will also train your problem solving skills which is really a case of killing two birds with one stone.

Here are a few predictions of topics for Engineering Applicants.

### Mechanics
1. Rotational Mechanics
Moment of Inertia and Rotational Kinetic Energy

2. Change of Reference Frame
Changing from the inertial reference frame to the Center of Mass reference frame

3. Constraint Equations
Constraint equations for pulley systems

4.

### Electricity and Magnetism


### Mathematical Techniques
1. Using Integration in Solving Physics Problems
[Here]( https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus/Book%3A_Calculus_(OpenStax)/06%3A_Applications_of_Integration/6.5%3A_Physical_Applications_of_Integration ) are examples of this technique being put to use
